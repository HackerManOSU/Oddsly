## Formulas and Calculations

### Implied Probability
Used to determine if a bet offers positive value. Calculated as:
```javascript
impliedProbability = 1 / decimalOdds;
```

### Kelly Criterion

```javascript
kellyFraction = (edge / odds) * (bankroll);
```

### Conversion Formulas

- Positive: `+((decimalOdds - 1) * 100)`
- Negative: `-(100 / (decimalOdds - 1))`
